# WallpaperScript

Changes the wallpaper according to weather conditions. The conditions are fetched from openweathermap.org. I have used the
API to fetch the current weather data. This is free and allows upto 60 calls per minute. It also allows a 5 day/3 hour forecast of the weather. Create an account and use the API key given.

To run the script in the background, Cron has been used. Cron is a time based scheduler. I have made this script run in the background every hour.
